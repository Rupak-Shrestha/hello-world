# hello-world
#hi-to everyone,
  I have learnt html5, css3 and now learning javascripton my own. And academically I'm studying Bsc. CSIT where I learnt c-programming and now I'm learning c++ programming.
  With what I have learnt and learning, I wanna develop a website that will collect other websites which will convincing people that google is not the only search engine, youtube is not the only video streaming site, and so on.
